Smart Waste Management System for Urban Areas<br>

Developed an intelligent system to streamline waste collection in urban environments. The solution monitors waste bin levels, manages collection schedules dynamically, and classifies waste into categories such as e-waste, plastic, and organic.

Key Features:<br>

-Real-time waste bin monitoring and dynamic route optimization.<br>
-Special waste collection requests for large or unique items.<br>
-Waste categorization for better recycling (e-waste, plastic, organic).<br>
